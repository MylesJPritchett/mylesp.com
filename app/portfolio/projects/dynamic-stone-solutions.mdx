This is a simple one page website with minimal amounts of Javascript so that it has fast load times. Load times are the most important part of this website as it is going to be used purely as an advertising material.

The business is not very technology orientated so it's customers are not expecting to see a complicated website full of animations.

The business simply wanted a way for them to give some information of their product, and show some pictures of their previous work.

This is a next.js app, written in typescript. It was made for a friend of mine who owns a bar. He wanted to quickly see what cocktails he could make with the ingredients he had on hand.

You can search for both ingredients and recipes from the file you upload. You can then filter both ingredients by clicking on one or many target recipes, to only show the ingredients that are neccesary to make them.

The recipes are sorted by the amount of additional ingredients selected from the list.

The ingredients are sorted by their "impact", i.e. how many recipes they would complete if selected, and then how many recipes they would make closer to completion.

This is a webapp that suggests recipes based on the ingredients you have at home. It is built with Next.js and hosted on my personal website. The app suggests recipes based on a number of factors, including the ingredients you have available already, the type of meals you like, and the time you have to cook.

I made this as a program that I would use at the start of the week to decide what groceries I need to buy. I was tired of buying ingredients for a recipe I never got around to making, so I made this app to suggest recipes based on what I already have.

My hope is instead of needing to sit down and plan out what meals I wanted to eat for the week, I can simply check the app and quickly sort through a list of recipes that fit my needs to make the descision easier.
